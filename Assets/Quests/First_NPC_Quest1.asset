  initialDialog:
  - Oh, there you are, darling. I've sensed your presence long before you stepped
    into my world. I find myself in need of assistance. Let mommy tell you what's
    wrong.
  - The balance of this realm is off-kilter, disrupted by the overpopulation of light
    rabbits. Though they may seem kawaii UwU and harmless, they feed on the life
    force of this land, leaving only decay in their wake.
  - 'I need you to thin their numbers. Will you accept this dark task? In return,
    I offer you a piece of my own power, a reward that transcends the mundane. '
  - Remember, appearances can be deceiving, and in our world, not everything is as
    it seems. There's always more than meets the eye.
  acceptOption: Shadow bunnies? Heh, guess it's time to put 'Bunny Wrangler' on my
    inter-dimensional resume.
  acceptAnswer: Well, look who's stepping up! Didn't think you had it in you, but
    you're full of surprises, aren't you?
  declineOption: As much as I'd love to add 'Professional Fluff-Chaser' to my list
    of isekai achievements... I think I'll pass. I mean, what's next? Ghostly goldfish?
    Ping me when there's a non-furry apocalypse!
  declineAnswer: Oh, honey, backing out so soon? Thought you had a bit more spark
    in you. It's cool, though. When you're ready to step up to the big leagues, you
    know where to find me. Until then, toodles!
  comebackAfterDecline: Oh? Back so soon? Realized you can't resist the allure of
    light bunnies? Or just missed my charming company? Maybe the thought of getting
    a little furry action tempted you back? Don't worry, I won't tell. Ready to hop
    into the fray this time?
  comebackInProgress: Aww, sweetie, still tussling with those elusive shadow bunnies?
    They sure are more slippery than they appear, huh? But remember, every hero needs
    their... let's say, 'beach episode' moment. Think of this as your playful, little
    filler challenge before the big plot twist. And darling, always remember, mommy's
    here cheering you on. Need a little encouragement or just craving mommy's comforting
    words? Just pop by. Now, be careful out there and no running with those swords,
    okay?
  comebackCompleted: Well, if it isn't the bunny conqueror! Managed to wrangle those
    fluffy bunnies without getting your hands too dirty? Impressive. But then again,
    I had a feeling you'd be good with your hands. Here's the reward I promised,
    though I'm sure you're curious about other... rewards I might offer. Stick around,
    and you just might find out. Ready for what comes next, or need a breather?
  finalWords: "Well, well, didn't expect Mr. Bunny Wrangler to steal the show, did
    we? You've got moves, and I'm not just talking about the quest. Until our paths
    cross again \u2013 and trust me, they will \u2013 stay wild and unpredictable.
    Catch you on the flip side!"
